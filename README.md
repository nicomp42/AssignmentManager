# AssignmentManager
Process assignments submitted for grading

The program reads a folder of zip files and unzips them to another folder. 

The folders being unzipped are assumed to be Eclipse projects but the logic should work for any zipped thing.

It creates any folders it finds in the zipped file. That's pretty cool because, well, it's just cool.

Important: each .zip file that is processed should contain only a folder. Inside that contained folder should be the Eclipse project.
     
	 example: the zip file nicholdw_Assignment01.zip should contain a folder, probably called nicholdw_Assignment01. 
                  Inside that folder would be the entire Eclipse project.
